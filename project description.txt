Use the facedetect.py example
Originally, the program detect human's faces and mark them with green rectangles.
It also detect human's eyes and mark them with blue rectangles.
We change the RGB parameters to change the colors of those rectangles.
We also change the parameters of the rectangles to change the size of the lines.
